April 13th:

We have successfully parsed the events and we are being able to display them in swing.
Things to do:
	Edit the text
	Add a background
	Make default image to work
	Overall Animation and Decor




Problem 1:
	Only the thumbnail of the events posters are avialable in to parse from the website.
	How to get the relative path images.
